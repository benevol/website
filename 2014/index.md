## Call for participation

The BENEVOL software evolution research seminar aims to gather junior
and senior researchers from Belgium, the Netherlands, and neighboring
countries to meet and to discuss new ideas, important problems and
obtained research results in the field of software evolution.

Prospective speakers (junior or senior researchers or practitioners
active in the field) are invited to submit an extended abstract (max.
2 A4 pages) of a talk. Based on these extended abstracts, the
organization will construct an exciting program. The seminar
particularly welcomes presentations of ongoing research or tools
developed by PhD students. Senior researchers will provide the
necessary feedback and lively discussions.

### Invited speakers

As every year, we will have invited talks by key researchers in the field:

- Rainer Koschke (University of Bremen): “Software Clone Management: Past, Present and the Future”

- Leon Moonen (Simula Research Laboratory): "Supporting Certification and Evolution of Cyber-Physical Product Families"
